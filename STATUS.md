# Status

What exists, what is a stub, and what claim is *not* being made yet. Written in
the register [rust/fe-c](../fe-c/STATUS.md) uses: a sentence here is either
backed by a check that passes or is marked unmeasured.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-27.
**Tier:** T0 (PLAN.md §8), in progress.

## Pins

| Thing | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IR dialect | LLVM 21 | The major that `nixpkgs.llvm` (21.1.8) and the repo's rustc both speak. Older dialects are refused, not half-supported. |
| Oracle LLVM | `pkgs.llvm` 21.1.8 | Test-only, inside check derivations. Never a build or runtime dependency of any package output. |
| Rust toolchain | stable, whatever the devshell ships (1.95 today) | No `rust-toolchain.toml` yet on purpose: nothing here needs nightly. The pin arrives with `crates/rustc-codegen-llvmrs` (task B5), which needs `rustc_private`. |
| Third-party crates | none | The whole workspace has zero dependencies, so there is nothing to add to `nix/lib/cargo/index` yet. |

## What works

This section grows one row per completed task in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) §4,
and each row names the check that backs it.

| Area | State | Backed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace, docs, nix wiring | done | `llvm-fmt`, `llvm-clippy`, `llvm-unit` |
| APInt: arbitrary-width integer arithmetic, formatting, parsing | done | `llvm-unit`, cross-checked against native `u128` over an operand grid at eleven widths |
| APFloat: bit-pattern carrier plus LLVM's textual forms | done | `llvm-unit`, including every `half` and `bfloat` bit pattern |
| DataLayout: parsing, alignment queries, verbatim printing | done | `llvm-unit` |
| Triple: component parsing, verbatim printing | done | `llvm-unit` |
| IR data model: types, constants, instructions, attributes, metadata | done | `llvm-unit`, and the round trip below, which cannot pass without it |
| Textual printer | done, byte-identical to `llvm-dis` over the corpus | `llvm-roundtrip` |
| Textual parser | done for everything the corpus contains | `llvm-roundtrip` |
| Type layout: sizes, alignments, struct offsets | done | `llvm-unit` |

## The round trip

Every file in `corpus/` is canonical `llvm-dis` output, and parsing one and
printing it back reproduces it byte for byte. As of 2026-07-27 that is 9
files and roughly 3,600 lines: 6 generated from real `rustc --emit=llvm-ir`
(arithmetic, control flow, memory, atomics, calls, unwinding) and 3
hand-written to pin syntax rustc never emits (module structure, one of every
instruction, one of every constant and type form).

This is a stronger property than "the parser accepted it". It says we agree
with upstream about slot numbering, predecessor order, blank lines, label
padding, which defaults print as nothing, and the several places where the
same attribute is spelled differently depending on where it sits.

## What is not started

Everything else. Concretely, and to forestall the usual optimistic reading of
a compiler project's README:

- **No code generation.** No instruction selection, no register allocation, no
  object emission, no assembler. `llc` does not exist.
- **No optimizer.** No pass manager beyond the identity, no analyses, no
  transforms. `opt -passes=instcombine` is an error, not a no-op.
- **No bitcode.** Reading and writing `.bc` are both T3. `llvm-as` and
  `llvm-dis` do not exist because their contract is bitcode.
- **No rustc backend.** `rustc_codegen_llvm` is not vendored, and no Rust
  program compiles through this project.
- **No debug info, no unwinding, no LTO, no PGO, no coverage.**
- **No C ABI.** `llvm-c-abi` is T5.

## Divergences from PLAN.md

Recorded so that the plan stays the plan and the deltas stay visible.

| Plan says | Reality | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rust-toolchain.toml` in the tree from the start (§4.1) | not present | Nothing in T0.1 needs nightly, and an unused pin is a maintenance cost plus a slower nix build. It lands with task B5, which is the first thing that needs `rustc_private`. |
| Use-lists as intrusive lists over indices (§4.2) | instruction storage is an arena, blocks hold `Vec<InstId>`, no use-lists yet | Def-use chains have no consumer before the first analysis pass. Instruction ids are stable regardless, which is the property that matters for retrofitting. |
| Vendor upstream tests under `corpus/upstream/` (§7.1) | upstream tests are read from `pkgs.llvm.src` in check derivations | Same coverage, no third-party import into the tree, and the oracle version is pinned by the flake lock rather than by a copy that silently ages. |
